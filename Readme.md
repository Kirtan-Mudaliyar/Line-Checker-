  <b>An exercise companion that counts your line checks during workouts using push buttons, buzzers, LCD, and an ultrasonic sensor.</b>

## Project Background

This project was inspired by a personal need during my exercise sessions — counting line checks manually became repetitive and error-prone.

So, I decided to apply my embedded systems knowledge to solve a real-world problem in my daily life.  
This Line Checker automatically tracks line checks based on your selection (15 / 20 / 30) and ensures focus during workouts without losing count.

## Features

<ul>
  <li> Real-time detection using an ultrasonic sensor</li>
  <li> Push buttons for selecting 15, 20, or 30 line check modes</li>
  <li> LCD displays the current count</li>
  <li> Buzzers provide short feedback after each check and a long buzz at the end</li>
</ul>

## How It Works

<ol>
  <li>On power-up, LCD prompts: <code>Enter number of Line checks :)</code></li>
  <li>Object must be within 30 cm (i.e., proximity detection for safety or interaction)</li>
  <li>User presses one of the buttons to start the count (15/20/30)</li>
  <li>Each count:
    <ul>
      <li>Increments line check count</li>
      <li>Displays on LCD</li>
      <li>Plays short buzzer sound</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Final count ends with a long buzzer beep</li>
</ol>

##  Simulation Notes

> Compatible with [Wokwi Arduino Simulator](https://wokwi.com/).  
> ⚠️ *Wokwi pushbuttons default to a "pressed" state — verify actual logic with physical hardware for accuracy.*
